# rss-events

RSS is a popular web syndication format that allows users to view updates to a site. This is a highly configurable serverless solution that behaves like a news aggregator for RSS, wherein multiple RSS sources are read at given internval, and events for newly discovered items in the RSS channel are sent to an EventBridge event bus. 

## Architecture

### Resources

  - **Sources Table** - DynamoDB table that holds all sources of RSS feeds
  - **Items Table** - DynamoDB table that record all RSS channel items for which events have been sent
  - **Channel Queue** - SQS queue that dispatches a message for each RSS feed
  - **Items Queue** - SQS queue that dispatches a message for each new channel item in an RSS feed
  - **Event Bus** - EventBridge event bus that receives events for every new channel item
  - **List Sources Function** - Lambda function that lists all sources of RSS feeds for processing
  - **Process Sources Function** - Lambda function that checks the RSS feed for new content
  - **Process Items Function** - Lambda function that sends an event to the event bus for each new channel item
